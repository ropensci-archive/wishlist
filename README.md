This repo used to be a wishlist of packages "list of things we need (a|new|updated) (package|client lib|binding) to/from" as Oliver Keyes originally tweeted. Suggest a package/idea [on the issue tracker](https://github.com/ropensci/wishlist/issues/). Although this repo sounds broad, the focus is on packages that broadly have a scientific application. We will shortly spin off related repos for projects that fall outside this scope.

Before contributing an idea please see [our contribution guidelines](contributing.md) first.
